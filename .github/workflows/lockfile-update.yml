            This PR regenerates composer.lock to match Laravel ^12.0 and updates the dev test stack
            (Pest + pest-plugin-laravel) to a Laravel 12 compatible version.
            
            Note: Composer advisory PKSA-8qx3-n5y5-vvnd was ignored for dependency resolution via COMPOSER_AUDIT_IGNORE.
